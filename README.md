# Romulus Engine
> Romulus Engine was used as launchpad for learning the Vulkan Rendering API and getting more familiar with rendering pipelines for modern game engines.
> The project intended to become similar to a game engine sandbox where I implemented ideas and features from the book [Game Engine Architecture](https://www.gameenginebook.com/).
